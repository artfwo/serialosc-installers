serialosc was made possible by generous amounts of pre-existing open-source code. in particular, it includes liblo for network communication and libconfuse for configuration files. these projects are made available licensed under the LGPL and ISC licenses (respectively).

this would not have been possible without these projects, and I will gladly buy a round of drinks for the authors and/or maintainers should we run into each other.

serialosc and libmonome are themselves released under the very permissive ISC license.
